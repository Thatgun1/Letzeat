          Pan-Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Quesadillas Another great starter OR
          this can work as a light meal. This selection works beautifully on an
          outdoor grill, but can also be made indoors (when it�s too cold to
          grill on Super Bowl Sunday) Ingredients are easy to pull together,
          you�re applying your new-found skills at saut�ing vegetables and
          plenty of chopping. When made correctly, it will have a light, crunchy
          outside with soft, melted blend of flavors inside. I have won several
          side dish awards at barbecue contests with this favorite. Now... the
          secret is in your hands.
